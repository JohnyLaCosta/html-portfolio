<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  If your corporate culture is inclusive and gives opportunities to young people
  like me, who are enthusiastically looking to join a team where they can learn
  from the best in IT, don't hesitate to get to know me. I want to develop a
  career within the scope of my skills and I will dedicate myself fully to any
  projects that may challenge me. I want to grow any company that is willing to
  make me grow with it.
</p>
<p>
  I had the privilege of starting work in Coimbra (at One Source – curricular
  internship – and at IPN) as a Helpdesk Technician and at the moment I want to
  work in the Lisbon Region and reinforce skills in the Networks or Programming
  area. If you are looking for someone with desire, dynamism, professionalism,
  dedication and who really enjoys working in a team and sharing ideas, don't
  hesitate. Detailed analysis of my Linkedin profile and CV is a start. Thank
  you for your interest and openness.

<p>Compliments,</p>
